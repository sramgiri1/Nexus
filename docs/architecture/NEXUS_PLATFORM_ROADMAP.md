# NEXUS Platform Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-05-06

---

## Purpose

This roadmap tracks the public platform build-out of NEXUS as an Agentic OS and
clarifies which phases are complete, which are architecture-only, and which are
still future implementation work.

The public repo uses `DemoApp` for showcase material. Private product work
belongs in separate private repos.

- Phase 11 Tooling and capability model
- Phase 12 Observability, evals, and artifacts
- Phase 13 Demo and showcase mode
- Phase 14 Domain ownership policy
- Phase 15-LOCAL Runtime traffic plane and identity propagation
- Phase 16-LOCAL Command Center live wiring
- Phase 17-LOCAL Local state adapter and read API boundary
- Phase 18-LOCAL Local orchestrator read/write integration plan
- Phase 19-LOCAL Orchestrator adapter dry-run mode
- Phase 20-LOCAL Controlled local execution mode

## Current Phase

### Phase 21-LOCAL — Command Center Runtime File Ingestion

Goal:

- surface real local runtime-file summaries in Command Center through a
  generated browser-safe snapshot without adding API, DB, mutation, providers,
  or tool execution

Deliverables:

- runtime file normalizer
- Command Center snapshot generator
- dashboard runtime snapshot data module
- Command Center runtime-state panels
- validation against read-only snapshot-ingestion rules

Non-goals:

- no API server
- no DB
- no live browser filesystem reads
- no mutation endpoints
- no real provider calls
- no tool execution
- no dispatch rewrite
- no project mutation

Validation checks:

- runtime summaries are derived from `local-state/runtime`
- generated snapshot stays read-only and browser-safe
- Command Center surfaces recent runtime file data
- dashboard and existing local validation surfaces remain green

Risk level:

- medium

## Upcoming

### Phase 15 — Containerization and Worker Scaling

Goal:

- scale execution beyond local host while preserving kernel boundaries

Deliverables:

- linux worker strategy
- queue and lease architecture
- runtime scheduling policy
- eventual container execution path

Non-goals:

- not replacing `macos-xcode`

Validation checks:

- container workers do not claim iOS capability
- worker leases and evidence path are durable

Risk level:

- high

### Phase 16 — Production Hardening

Goal:

- make NEXUS safe for long-running production use

Deliverables:

- retention and backup design
- audit hardening
- operational runbooks
- reliability and safety completion pass

Non-goals:

- not early feature experimentation

Validation checks:

- backup and recovery story exists
- audit and approval paths are complete

Risk level:

- high

### Future Public Platform Work

Goal:

- continue turning the public repo into a recruiter-, investor-, and reviewer-
  friendly proof surface without leaking private work

Deliverables:

- replay mode
- stronger public screenshots and walkthrough assets
- future runtime enforcement milestones
- API and DB implementation phases when the boundaries are ready
- public repo separation from old private history when a clean export is ready

Non-goals:

- not exposing private product ideas in the public repo

Validation checks:

- showcase remains public-safe
- proof surfaces remain evidence-first

Risk level:

- medium

## Private Product Work Later

Private product delivery should resume only after the public OS foundation,
runtime enforcement, approvals, safety boundaries, and durable execution path
are more mature. That work belongs in private repos, not in the public DemoApp
showcase surface.
